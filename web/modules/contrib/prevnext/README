SUMMARY
========
PrevNext (Previous/Next) is a simple module that provides, for any node type you want, 
two links to the previous and to the next node, published, of the same type and the same language.

You can choose for what type of node you want to enable these links through a simple
configuration panel. Once you enabled the content types you want, in the
"Manage Display" of that types you'll find two new "extra fields":
one for previous and one for next link.

Moreover, for Previous/Next links, you'll find a unique twig template through which you can
customize the html structure, add classes and something like this.


HOW TO USE IT
==============
- Enable prevnext module
- Enable/disable links on content types from "admin/config/user-interface/prevnext"
- Go to the "Manage Display" of the nodes you enabled
- Enjoy!
